   This error is because the center element is deprecated, and instead this should be done with CSS.
    
2. To show "Firstname" and "Lastname" as a placeholder in the form text box, you must add: value="Firstname" after name="firstName"
and value="Lastname" after name="lastName"

This is overkill in my opinion because the field is already labeled for the user.

3. To have the checkbox indicating that a defailed BMI analysys is desired automatically checked when the page is displayed, 
you must add: checked after value="yes".

ex: <input type="checkbox" name="details" value="yes" checked></td>

4. If you dont want the inches or pounds to show up in the Units: boxes, you must add an extra option with a &#160; blank char.

ex: <option>&#160;</option> above the inches/pounds etc. This will also allow the blank space to be validated with w3c validator.

5. Besides the additional browser compatibility, the label tags make following the code easier, as it creates identifiers which
